# 🔐 AuthFlow

**AuthFlow** simulates a basic web app that supports multiple authentication flows—passwords, OTPs (One-Time Passwords), magic links, and biometric mockups. It allows users to understand how Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) works under the hood, including token validation, session management, and the various mechanisms that ensure secure access to web applications.

AuthFlow is designed to educate developers and security professionals on the principles of secure authentication, session management, and the inner workings of MFA.

## 📌 Features

- 🔑 **Multiple Authentication Flows**:
  - **Password-based Authentication**: Simulate login with traditional username/password credentials
  - **OTP Authentication**: Support for OTPs sent via email or SMS
  - **Magic Links**: Login via email-based magic links (no password required)
  - **Biometric Authentication**: Mockups of biometric login systems (e.g., fingerprint or face recognition)

- 🔒 **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Simulation**:
  - Simulates the MFA process by combining different authentication methods (e.g., password + OTP, password + biometric)
  - Illustrates token generation, validation, and expiration in a simple flow
  - Demonstrates how session management works with MFA, including token-based authentication (JWT)

- 🛡️ **Token Validation & Session Management**:
  - Shows how tokens (JWT, session tokens) are generated, validated, and stored securely
  - Simulates token expiration and refresh tokens to maintain secure sessions
  - Demonstrates best practices for session management and preventing session hijacking

- 📊 **Interactive Walkthroughs**:
  - Step-by-step explanations of each authentication flow
  - Visual representation of the MFA process and the role of different security mechanisms
  - Interactive mockups for testing different authentication methods in real-time

- 🧑‍💻 **Developer Education**:
  - Helps developers understand the inner workings of modern authentication systems
  - Provides insights into token management, session handling, and security practices
  - Offers code snippets and configuration examples for implementing MFA in web apps

- 🔧 **Customizable Authentication Flows**:
  - Developers can customize the authentication flow to simulate different scenarios
  - Add new authentication methods or tweak session management behaviors
  - Easily integrate AuthFlow into existing projects for educational purposes

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Redux, Material UI
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express), Python (Flask/Django)
- **Authentication**: JWT, OAuth2, Twilio (for OTPs), MagicLink (for email-based login)
- **Biometrics**: Simulated via mock APIs or images (for educational purposes)
- **Session Management**: JWT, Redis (for token storage)
